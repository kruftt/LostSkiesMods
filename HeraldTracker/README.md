# Herald Tracker

Adds a "Ping" icon to the Compass HUD at the location of the Herald.

Now tracks whales! Will display a notification when a whale has been added or removed from the compass. The whales can be quite shy! Sometimes they don't spawn for quite awhile.  

Whale and/or Herald tracking can be disabled in the config file `kruft.heraldtracker.cfg`, located in the `BepInEx/config` folder.
